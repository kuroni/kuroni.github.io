## Competing

I have been doing competitive programming since 2016 (wow that's almost a decade ago!) My proudest achievement is qualifying for ICPC World Finals four times (despite there being a hard limit of two); this is due to COVID restrictions messing up the ICPC timeline :) My other achievements are:

- 20th at ICPC World Finals 2021 and 31st at ICPC World Finals 2023.
- Bronze Medal at ICPC North American Championship 2020 and 2023.
- 4th place at Vietnam Team Selection Test 2018 and 2019.
- Numerous Google Code Jam and Facebook Hacker Cup Round 3 appearances (no finals yet however).

## Problem setting

I have set many contests/problems before. A non-comprehensive list of contests to which I have been a part of the problem setting team is:
- [VNOI CUP](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/132008): An open-age on-site competitive programming competition series for Vietnamese, highly regarded as the most prestigious contest of its kind. I have been the head of judge for the [2023](https://oj.vnoi.info/contest/vnoicup23_final_mirror) and [2024](https://oj.vnoi.info/contest/vnoicup24_final_mirror) series.
- [ICPC Hue Regional 2023](https://icpcvn.github.io/2023/regional/scoreboard.html).
- Codeforces: [Round 482](https://codeforces.com/contest/979), [Round 558](https://codeforces.com/contest/1163), [Round 616](https://codeforces.com/contest/1290), [Ozon Tech Challenge 2020](https://codeforces.com/contest/1305), [Global Round 9](https://codeforces.com/contest/1375), [Round 668](https://codeforces.com/contest/1404), [Round 715](https://codeforces.com/contest/1508), [Global Round 25](https://codeforces.com/contest/1951).

## Coaching

I have been coaching [ICPC at UT Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~utpc/ICPC.html) since Fall 2023. We have had one ICPC World Finals appearance in 2024.

I have also coached part-time for the Vietnamese IOI team in 2023 and 2024.
